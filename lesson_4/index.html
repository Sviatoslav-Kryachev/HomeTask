		<P class="introduction">As all over the world, car buyers who dream of moving from public transport to the wheel of their own car, wanting to do it for the lowest price, focus on the segment of used cars. Ukraine is no exception.</P>

<h3>There are three common ways to buy an inexpensive car:</h3>
<div class="list-block">
<ul class="list-car">
	<li>purchase of a used car with Ukrainian registration;</li>
	<li>cars from American insurance auctions;</li>
	<li>"Eurobikes" with foreign license plates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="about-car">This article provides important information about where and how to choose a car if you are a novice driver. Let's understand this question in more detail.</p>
<h3 class="ukranian-car" id="ukranian-car">Ukrainian car</h3>
<p class="about-ukranian">Experts say - you can buy a used car with Ukrainian registration and have it reissued to a new owner in Ukraine within 24 hours. The buyer can usually have a one-on-one conversation with the owner, learn everything about the technical condition and the service history of the car. However, not all technical information, given by car sellers, is worth believing.</p>

<p class="text-bottom">It is very easy to cheat the mileage figures of cars. Absolutely everybody does it: both resellers and car owners. Looking for a car with real mileage, especially in large cities, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

</div>
<h3>The cost of used cars with Ukrainian registration decreases depending on age:</h3>
<div class="list-block">
	<ul class="list-car">
		<li>3-5 years with 50,000 miles will cost a third less than new;</li>
		<li>5-7 years with mileage of 100,000 kilometers - cheaper by half;</li>
		<li>older than 10 years with mileage of 200,000 kilometers can be purchased cheaper and 80% cheaper.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="rastamogka">
	<p>At the same time, you will not need to clear the customs and pay the excise tax for a car from the secondary market. However, when buying a used car, you should check its technical condition at the service station, and find out all the nuances of legal history and ownership issues.</p>
	<p>Unscrupulous sellers may not tell about the defects revealed, overpriced at the same time. An objective picture can be obtained by contacting specialized companies, which are professionally engaged in servicing transactions with cars on the secondary market.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="auction-cars" id="auction-cars">Auction cars</h3>
<div class="sales-cars">
<p>On the Ukrainian market of used cars, cars with Ukrainian registration lose in price not only to "Eurobikes", but also to cars purchased at auctions overseas. They are cheaper on the average by 20-30%.</p>
<p>The low price of cars purchased at insurance company auctions in the U.S. has a simple explanation. These cars have been in accidents, it can also be a "drowned" or a car that was stolen. Because of the high cost of service stations in America, many used cars are not repaired there, and are sold at auctions for such a small price that it is profitable to take the cars across the ocean and have them repaired here.</p>
</div>
<div class="picture-img">
<img class="key"	src="img/3.jpg" alt="Автопарк ">
</div>
<div class="sales-cars">
<p>It is advantageous to buy a used car through an auction if it costs more than $10,000. When buying an auction car, the cost savings, compared to the aftermarket, can range from $2,000 to $10,000.</p>
<p>However, the total cost to buyers of the same make can vary greatly depending on the nature of the damage (on which the cost of repairs depends), the increase in the starting price during the auction, and other factors. Automotive experts warn that buyers of overseas cars do not always deal with bona fide sellers, auction sites and intermediary agents.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="evro-cars" id="evro-cars">Cars on Euro numbers</h3>
<p class="evro-bliaxi">It is even cheaper to buy a car with foreign license plates - "Eurobliches". Many believe that it is better to use the services of specialized companies and buy a 15-year Audi abroad than an 8-year Daewoo in Ukraine for the same money.</p>
<div class="picture-img">

</div>
<div class="sales-cars">
	<p>It is true that such a purchase has its pitfalls. In this case, the ownership of the purchased car will belong not to you, but to the foreign company through which the car was purchased. You won't be able to clear or sell the car in Ukraine, and will use it only by virtue of power of attorney. In such a situation there are hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian owners of cars with foreign license plates.</p>
	<p>As you see, this is not a purchase of the car. Rather it is a purchase of a possibility to drive it. You don't have documents for car ownership. You may try to sell it to someone who takes your word for it and agrees to pay just for the opportunity to drive it. That's a pretty good prospect, don't you think?</p>

<h3 class="insurance" id="insurance">Do not forget about insurance</h3>
<p class="insurance-info">After buying a car, you must buy compulsory automobile insurance, which will compensate the injured party in the event of an accident. This insurance will allow you to avoid unnecessary costs for repairs to your car.</p>
<div class="picture-img">
	<img class="key"	src="img/5.jpeg" alt="Важно о страховке ">
</div>
<p class="example">For example, even minor dents and scratches fall within the coverage area of insurance with the now popular zero deductible. This is very important in the case of a novice driver.</p>
<h3 class="recomendation" id="recomendation">General recommendations</h3>
<p class="example">Regardless of your choice of car, whether American or European, there are some rules to follow. When buying a car in the showroom, before you sign any documents, make sure that all purchased additional equipment is in place. This includes:</p>
<div class="list-block">
<ul class="list-car">
	<li>all kinds of protection;</li>
	<li>mats;</li>
	<li>spare tire;</li>
	<li>fire extinguisher;</li>
	<li>original first-aid kit, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="bottom-info">
<p class="bottom1">Checks should be carried out in advance, it makes no sense to go to the showroom afterwards. After all, you have "carefully" checked everything and signed the documents yourself.</p>
<p class="bottom2">Inattention can cost a considerable sum of money. Conclusion - when buying any goods, be it a car or other equipment, carefully check the package according to your real purchase.</p>
